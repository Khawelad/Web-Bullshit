			<strong><u>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ONLINE PURCHASE</u></strong>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Default prices mentioned are in Pakistani Rupee.</li>
			<li>The prices mentioned are inclusive of 14% General Sales Tax (GST).</li>
			<li>Payment(s) made in a foreign currency will be valued at net receipts in our Pakistani Rupee Account net of any transfer fees, charges and deductions at the prevalent exchange rates.</li>
			<li>Prices are exclusive of any additional charges and fund transfer fee.</li>
			<li>
				We do our best to make sure that prices are correctly shown, but in case an error occurs, we will not accept the order and the order will have to be replaced with the correct price. In case payment has already been made, the excess
				amount will be refunded or short amount will need to be paid.
			</li>
			<li>It is the sole discretion of Nextag to change the prices without any prior notice.</li>
			<li>Any custom duty or other levies of any kind will be customer’s obligation.</li>
			<li>Slight color variations are always possible because of the nature of leather and the fact that reproduction of colors on monitor is possible to that extent which the photographic process reasonably allows.</li>
			<li>Color ordered may be out of stock &amp; an alternate color may be offered at the time of delivery with customer’s consent.</li>
			<li>It may be possible that the accessory/trim displayed is not available and instead an alternate but similar item will be used in terms of finish &amp; color.</li>
			<li>Please note that the time of delivery is the estimated time and does not include public holiday(s), announced or otherwise.</li>
			<li>Your order will be processed for delivery once the payment is received and confirmed by our representative; hence the delivery time count starts thereafter.</li>
			<li>Because of any uncertain circumstances, delivery time can be changed without any prior notice, although Nextag strongly endeavors to meet its timelines.</li>
			<li>It is your responsibility to ensure the delivery address is ready and able to accept delivery of the product.</li>
			<li>In case of in-accurate mailing address provided by the customer or unavailability of person to accept delivery in two attempts by the courier; no claims/refunds would be entertained.</li>
			<li>Nextag is not liable of any losses whatsoever included but not limited to damage, delay, miss delivery or non-delivery of your orders by Courier Company.</li>
			<li>Payment may be made by any single one of the methods indicated at the checkout page on our website. However, we are unable to process orders with more than one method of payment.</li>
			<li>Nextag’s online store is a separate entity from the retail outlets and neither has any connection with the other. Therefore, if you have any queries or concerns, kindly contact us over email at mail@Nextag.com.pk or by phone.</li>
